# Bonus 2: Kotlin migration

I do this task migrating class by class taking advantage of Kotlin-Java compatibility. I run the app for each class migrated to check everything is fine. After that I like to do a little refactor and make the most of Kotlin, for instance, using it null-safe capabilities.
