# Task 4: Refreshments

I have added a swipe refreshing layout instead of a floating button or similar widget because I think it is more friendly for most of users. 

We only have to add it to list fragment layout and instantiate it from ListFragment. I also added a listener to retrieve data when user swipes the layout to top limit and dismiss refresh drawable when the task is done.
